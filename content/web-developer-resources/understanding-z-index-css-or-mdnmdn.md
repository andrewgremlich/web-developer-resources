description: "In the most basic cases, when text, images, and other elements are arranged on the page without overlapping, HTML pages can be considered two-dimensional. In such cases, there is a single rendering flow, and all elements are aware of the space taken by others. CSS isn't that simple â€” CSS positioning, transformation, containment, and other features can cause elements to overlap. In this guide, we introduce the z-index property, which lets you place elements in front or behind other elements in the same stacking context."
