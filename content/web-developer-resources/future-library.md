description: "One thousand trees have been planted in Nordmarka, a forest just               outside Oslo, which will supply paper for a special anthology of books to be printed in one hundred               years time. Between now and then, one writer every year will contribute a text, with the writings held in trust, unpublished, until the year               2114."
