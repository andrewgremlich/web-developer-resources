It’s written for those who are always looking for more and don’t settle for abstraction. Key features # Focus on protocols and APIs, not specific software. Summarizes RFCs and collects undocumented knowledge. Vendor-agnostic approach. Not a tutorial - contains minimal code. WebRTC is a powerful technology, but it can be challenging to use."
